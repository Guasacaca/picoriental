\chapter{Fundamentals and Related Work\label{cha:tf}}

Multiclassification has been topic that has been explored frequently in a diverse number of fields. 
...
 Next we present some of the related work done in this are of knowledge:
\subsection{Text Categorization (Natural Language Processing)}
If movies were Computer Science, and actors and their lives were the different topics and fields of study in Computer Science, Machine Learning would be something like the Kardashians. Everyone has heard of it, everyday there are news about it and not everyone really knows what's really going on. 
Multiclassification and Multilabels....
\subsection{Scalable Data Algorithms}
With the nowadays always increasing amount of data, the need of mechanisms to proccess and deal with the data we are producing, and need to consume is needed.
book, scale, distribution, spark
\subsection{Taxonomy in the web}
flat vs hierarchical

\section{Technologies \label{sec:tech}}

This section describes relevant technologies, starting with X followed by Y, concluding with Z.

\subsection{Technology A\label{sec:aaa}}

It's always a good idea to explain a technology or a system with a citation of a prominent source, such as a widely accepted technical book or a famous person or organization. 

Exmple: Tim-Berners-Lee describes the ''WorldWideWeb'' as follows:
\\
\textit{''The WorldWideWeb (W3) is a wide-area hypermedia information retrieval initiative aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents.''} \cite{timwww}
\\
\\
You can also cite different claims about the same term.
\\
According to Bill Gates \textit{''Windows 7 is the best operating system that has ever been released''} \cite{billgates} (no real quote)
In opposite Steve Jobs claims Leopard to be \textit{''the one and only operating system''} \cite{stevejobs}

If the topic you are talking about can be grouped into different categories you can start with a classification.
Example: According to Tim Berners-Lee XYZ can be classified into three different groups, depending on foobar \cite{timwww}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Mobile X
				\vspace{-0.1in} 
		\item Fixed X
				\vspace{-0.1in} 
		\item Combined X
 	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technology B\label{sec:bbb}}

For internal references use the 'ref' tag of LaTeX. Technology B is similar to Technology A as described in section \ref{sec:aaa}.
